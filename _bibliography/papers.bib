  abstract = "The mechanisms for how large-scale brain networks contribute to
              sustained attention are unknown. Attention fluctuates from moment
              to moment, and this continuous change is consistent with dynamic
              changes in functional connectivity between brain networks
              involved in the internal and external allocation of attention. In
              this study, we investigated how brain network activity varied
              across different levels of attentional focus (i.e., ``zones'').
              Participants performed a finger-tapping task, and guided by
              previous research, in-the-zone performance or state was
              identified by low reaction time variability and out-of-the-zone
              as the inverse. In-the-zone sessions tended to occur earlier in
              the session than out-of-the-zone blocks. This is unsurprising
              given the way attention fluctuates over time. Employing a novel
              method of time-varying functional connectivity, called the
              quasi-periodic pattern analysis (i.e., reliable, network-level
              low-frequency fluctuations), we found that the activity between
              the default mode network (DMN) and task positive network (TPN) is
              significantly more anti-correlated during in-the-zone states
              versus out-of-the-zone states. Furthermore, it is the
              frontoparietal control network (FPCN) switch that differentiates
              the two zone states. Activity in the dorsal attention network
              (DAN) and DMN were desynchronized across both zone states. During
              out-of-the-zone periods, FPCN synchronized with DMN, while during
              in-the-zone periods, FPCN switched to synchronized with DAN. In
              contrast, the ventral attention network (VAN) synchronized more
              closely with DMN during in-the-zone periods compared with
              out-of-the-zone periods. These findings demonstrate that
              time-varying functional connectivity of low frequency
              fluctuations across different brain networks varies with
              fluctuations in sustained attention or other processes that
              change over time.",
