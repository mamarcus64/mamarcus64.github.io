<!--  Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hey there! I'm a Master's student at Georgia Tech researching the intersection of language and intelligence. I also graduated from Georgia Tech with a Computer Science degree with emphasis on [Intelligence](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/threads/intelligence) and [Theory](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/threads/theory) in May 2023. Feel free to check out any of my various experiences through the links above!

If you're looking for my research experiences, feel free to take a look at my [publications](/publications) or my [various lab involvements](/research/). I'd like to highlight my paper that was recently accepted into CSCW 2023, which investigates the differing responsibilities and expectations between couples when it comes to pregnancy prevention and how technology could potentially be used to create more equitable solutions. Also feel free to take a look at my various Natural Language Processing ventures, which span several labs and teaching experiences.

Or, if academia bores you, I encourage you to read [my write-ups on my several software internships](/experience), which I hope you'll find at least a little bit interesting. They're definitely written in a more casual style, so if business talk is more your speed, I'll promote my [resume](/resume) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcusma/) for those who just want to get down to brass tacks.
