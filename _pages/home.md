<!--  Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.

Hello! I am a PhD Student at USC in the [SAIL Lab](https://sail.usc.edu) advised by [Shrikanth Narayanan](https://viterbi.usc.edu/directory/faculty/Narayanan/Shrikanth) supported by the Andrew and Erna Viterbi Graduate Student Fellowship. I previously recieved my Undergraduate and Master's degrees in Computer Science from Georgia Tech with concentrations in [Intelligence](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/threads/intelligence) and [Theory](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/academics/threads/theory), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Wei Xu](https://cocoxu.github.io/) (Master's), [Jennifer Gahee Kim](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~jkim693/) (Undergrad), and [Lelia Glass](https://www.leliaglass.com/) (Undergrad).

I am broadly interested in **bridging the gap between how language models and humans understand language.** My research tackles this question from several directions. From a neuroscience perspective, I am investigating [how fMRI signals are interpreted by the human brain and the neural networks behind larguage language models](/research/#brain-score) for different language types. I also have previously investigated how [LLMs differentiate between the stylistics and semantics of written documents](/research/#authorship). Currently, I am using [rt-MRI scans to reconstruct audio from vocal tract contours](/research/#vocal-tract), building upon my research from Georgia Tech that [created an automated pipeline for improving transcription speed and accuracy](/research/#bedword). While LLMs are an impressive piece of technology, I don't think they the best vehicle for future development of artificial cognition. I hope to understand the core properties of human thought to inspire future research. 

Feel free to take a look at my [publications](/publications) or my [various lab involvements](/research/). I have also written descriptions of [my various software internships](/experience) along with my [resume](/resume).
