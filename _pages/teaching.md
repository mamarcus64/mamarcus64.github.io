<h3> Teaching Assistant for CS 4650: Natural Language Processing</h3>
<h4> Jan 2023 - May 2024 </h4>
Being a TA for CS 4650 has been invaluable in my experience for both understanding and communicating natural language processing. The average class attendance usually hovers around 100 students, so while grading the semester projects can certainly be a pain, my office hours are usually pretty busy from start to finish. The course covers a wide range of topics, starting with historic language processing techniques such as neural bag-of-words models and finishing up with encoder-decoder models and even briefly touching on modern-day applications of LLM's. My day-to-day tasks include checking and answering posts on our online forum platform Piazza, holding weekly office hours, attending lectures and answering in-person questions, and everyone's least favorite part of the job, grading. Overall, though, being a TA has been a great experience and I hope to keep teaching in some capacity in my future endeavors.

<h3> PLUS Leader for CS 1332: Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
<h4> Jan 2022 - Dec 2022 </h4>
As a PLUS (peer-led undergraduate study) Leader for Georgia Tech's most infamous "weed-out" course, teaching data structures and algorithms to new students is often a daunting task. During these sessions, I created diagrams, prompt discussions, and write practice coding problems for the various data structures covered in class. I held PLUS sessions twice week, which  saw attendence of up to 200 students. I'm happy to report that while the average class grade for CS 1332 was below a B average, the dozen or so students that regularly attended my PLUS sessions all recieved an A in the course.

<h3> One-on-one Tutor for Tutoring and Academic Support </h3>
<h4> Aug 2021 - Dec 2021 </h4>
I was a one-on-one tutor for Georgia Tech's Tutoring and Academic Support (TAS) program, where I tutored about five students a week on topics ranging from object oriented design, computer programming, and linear algebra.
